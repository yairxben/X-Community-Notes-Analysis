# X-Community-Notes-Analysis
Analysis of 1.2M+ X Community Notes using NLP and network analysis. Investigates the impact of trustworthy sources, contributor polarization, and the "consensus paradox" in crowdsourced fact-checking.

# **Motivation**
Who is actually fact-checking the fact-checkers? Beyond analyzing the notes themselves, this project scrutinizes the "crowd" behind them to see if contributors bridge divides or fracture into polarized echo chambers. We investigate whether user activity patterns signal healthy diversity or potential manipulation (e.g., bots) by hyperactive minority groups. Ultimately, we aim to answer a critical question: does Community Notes serve as a genuine corrective to misinformation, or does it risk reproducing the very societal divisions it was designed to fix?
